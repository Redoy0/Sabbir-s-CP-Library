Here we are going to explain how to manually calculate hours worked.  To do this, you will need a start and end time. The goal is to determine an entire duration worked using the recorded hours.  For example, starting @8:30 am and ending @3:45 pm would result in 7 hours and 15 minutes worked.

Here's how to determine hours worked:

Convert all times to 24 hour clock (military time):
Convert 8:45 am to 08:45 hours.
Convert 3:45 pm to 15:45 hours.
Next, Subtract the start time from the end time.
Now you have the actual hours worked for the day.
Finally to determined total time duration.
